# School Secretariat — Micro-Frontend Platform

A school-administration prototype built as a **micro-frontend (MFE) ecosystem**. A React host shell composes five independently deployable remotes at runtime with Module Federation, and the remotes stay in sync through a **typed, versioned domain-event contract** delivered over WebSocket.

The Go API that backs it lives in [`secretaria-backend`](https://github.com/fidelis27/secretaria-backend).

> **Status:** working, deployed prototype (Vercel + Render). It is not production-hardened; see [Limitations](#limitations).

## Why this project exists

The goal is to validate three things: separation of responsibilities by bounded context, stable integration contracts between MFEs, and the ability for different teams to evolve and deploy modules independently **without direct dependencies between screens**.

The domain is a school secretariat: an authorized agent manages institutions (several campuses, e.g. different Fatec units) and their students, with access control and a trail of every change.

### Key design decisions

- **Runtime composition.** Module Federation (`@originjs/vite-plugin-federation`). React, React DOM and `@mfe/shared` are singletons, so every remote shares one session and one event bus. Remote URLs come from `VITE_MFE_*_URL` variables, with local fallbacks for development.
- **Independent builds and deploys.** Each package has its own Vite build and its own Vercel project.
- **Two communication layers, each with one job.**
  - _In-page bus_ (`globalThis.__mfeBus`): local coordination between MFEs on the same page. Channels are namespaced `cmd:*` (host to MFE), `evt:*` (MFE to host) and `domain:*`. If nobody is listening, events wait in a per-channel queue (100 items, TTL, default 10 s); once a listener exists, delivery is fan-out.
  - _Backend domain events over WebSocket_: the host owns a single connection and re-dispatches each event to the bus, so remotes never open their own sockets.
- **Versioned event contract.** Every event carries `eventId`, `type`, `version`, `source`, `correlationId`, `occurredAt` and `payload`. Types are a discriminated union in `@mfe/shared`, and the `useDomainEvents` hook handles authenticated connection, reconnect with backoff, cleanup and typed parsing.
- **Failure isolation.** Remotes are loaded with `lazy` + `Suspense`, and the host wraps them in an error boundary, so one remote being down does not take the shell with it.
- **Accessibility as a gate.** Skip link, labelled fields, `aria-live` / `aria-busy` on async regions, `jest-axe` tests per MFE, and a color-contrast check that runs in CI.
- **Shared visual language.** Semantic tokens and typed UI primitives live in `@mfe/shared`; each application's Vite CSS Module is scoped beneath its own root to prevent remote styles from leaking across the federated page. See [`docs/design-system.md`](docs/design-system.md).
- **Performance by evidence.** The plan in [`docs/performance-improvement-plan.md`](docs/performance-improvement-plan.md) follows one rule: measure, change the smallest thing, measure again. It also lists what _not_ to optimize (no blanket memoization, no preloading every MFE).
- **Access-denied feedback.** The Student MFE shows friendly 403/404 errors and does not keep previously loaded rows visible after a denied refetch. E2E checks this UI behavior only; backend authorization remains the security boundary. The client does not yet know the user's institution scope, so a global scope selector/filter needs a trusted current-user scope source first.

## Getting started

Requirements: Node 22.13+, a Supabase project (email/password auth), and the [backend](https://github.com/fidelis27/secretaria-backend) running locally or deployed.

```bash
npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run dev:local     # PowerShell launcher (Windows): starts the host and the remotes
```

Build-time variables:

| Variable                                      | Purpose                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VITE_API_URL`                                | Backend base URL (HTTP and WebSocket)                     |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase Auth (anon key only; never the service role key) |
| `VITE_MFE_*_URL`                              | Remote entry origins used by the host                     |

Details: [`docs/local-development.md`](docs/local-development.md) and [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md).

## Quality gates

CI runs on every PR and a final **CI gate** job fails if any required job fails:

- ESLint, TypeScript typecheck, Prettier check
- Vitest unit, integration and accessibility tests
- Playwright E2E tests against the built Host and five real federation remotes, with deterministic API and WebSocket mocks
- Playwright checks that student-write 403 and student-list 403/404 responses are visible and do not leave a success state or stale rows
- Color-contrast check
- `npm audit --audit-level=high`
- Build matrix over all seven workspaces
- Playwright report and traces uploaded as an artifact when E2E fails

## How it was built

Spec first, in small verified steps. Product decisions and acceptance criteria were written down before code (`docs/archive/context.md`, specs), work was split into **one PR per block** with conventional commits and a "Validations" section listing the commands run, and AI assistants were used under those same rules. See `docs/archive/context.md` for the working agreement.

## Limitations

- Prototype scope: it demonstrates the architecture and the main flow (institution → student → event → activity/dashboard), not a finished product.
- Event delivery is best effort. A transactional outbox is still pending (see the backend ADR 0001).
- Runtime duplication of shared libraries across remotes is still to be measured before any change (PERF-007).
