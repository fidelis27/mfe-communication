# Architecture

Diagrams for the micro-frontend platform in this repository. The Go API, its data model and its API contract are documented in [`secretaria-backend`](https://github.com/fidelis27/secretaria-backend/blob/main/docs/architecture.md); this page treats it as an external system.

## 1. System context

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    user(["Secretariat agent"])

    subgraph browser["Browser"]
        host["Host shell<br/>auth, routing, one WebSocket"]
        remotes["5 remote MFEs<br/>institution, student, admin,<br/>activity, dashboard"]
        host -- "loads at runtime<br/>(Module Federation)" --> remotes
    end

    api["secretaria-backend<br/>(external, own repository)"]
    auth["Supabase Auth"]
    sentry["Sentry<br/>error tracking"]

    user --> host
    host -- "email + password" --> auth
    auth -- "access token (JWT)" --> host
    remotes -- "HTTPS + Bearer token" --> api
    host -- "WSS /events<br/>token in subprotocol" --> api
    host -. "host errors" .-> sentry
```

---

## 2. Runtime composition in the browser

The host owns the shell. Remotes are separate builds, loaded lazily. React,
React DOM, `@mfe/shared`, and `@tanstack/react-query` are federation
**singletons**. Each remote owns a separate `QueryClient` and cache; query data
is not shared across MFEs.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph host["Host (Vercel project)"]
        shell["Shell: nav, login, URL routing"]
        boundary["RemoteBoundary<br/>lazy + Suspense + error boundary"]
        ws["useDomainEvents<br/>single WebSocket, backoff reconnect"]
        shell --> boundary
        shell --> ws
    end

    subgraph remotes["Remotes (one Vercel project each)"]
        inst["mfe-institution<br/>/instituicoes"]
        stud["mfe-student<br/>/estudantes"]
        adm["mfe-admin<br/>/admin"]
        act["mfe-activity<br/>/atividade"]
        dash["mfe-dashboard<br/>/dashboard"]
    end

    subgraph queryClients["Remote-local query state"]
            queries["One isolated QueryClient per remote"]
    end

    featureApi["Per-MFE feature API modules<br/>Zod response validation"]

    subgraph shared["@mfe/shared (singleton)"]
        contract["Typed event contract"]
        bus["In-page bus<br/>globalThis.__mfeBus"]
        requestApi["Typed request helpers"]
        authlib["Auth + authenticatedFetch"]
        tokens["Design tokens"]
    end

    boundary -- "remoteEntry.js<br/>URL from VITE_MFE_*_URL" --> remotes
    host --> shared
    remotes --> featureApi --> requestApi --> authlib
    remotes --> queries
```

If one remote is down, only its `RemoteBoundary` shows "module unavailable"; the shell and the other remotes keep working.
The per-remote cache decision is documented in [ADR-0001](./adr/0001-query-client-per-remote.md).

---

## 3. Communication layers

Backend events use two communication layers, each with one job.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    api["Backend<br/>WSS /events"]

    subgraph page["Browser page"]
        hostws["Host WebSocket"]
        pagebus["__mfeBus (in-page)"]
        remotes["All five remotes"]
        hostws -- "domain:event envelope + domain:<type> payload" --> pagebus
        pagebus -- "event envelope with eventId" --> remotes
        remotes -- "update or invalidate cache" --> queryCache["Remote-local query caches"]
        remotes -- "evt:navigate" --> pagebus
        pagebus -- "cmd:navigate / evt:navigate" --> hostws
    end

    api -- "domain events" --> hostws
```

| Layer                                | Scope                            | Channels                                                                          | Use                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Backend domain events over WebSocket | Server to every connected client | event `type` (for example `STUDENT_CREATED`)                                      | State changes that other screens must react to |
| In-page bus                          | Same page only                   | `cmd:*` host to MFE, `evt:*` MFE to host, `domain:*` re-dispatched backend events | Navigation, modal close, connection status     |

Bus delivery rules: no listener means a per-channel queue (100 items, TTL 10 s by default); once a listener exists, delivery is fan-out. Details in [`event-bus.md`](event-bus.md).

HTTP requests follow this path: component → feature query hook → feature API
(`src/features/<feature>/api/`) → shared request helper →
`authenticatedFetch` → backend. Query functions pass their `AbortSignal` to the
API helper. Feature APIs validate JSON responses with Zod schemas and report
typed `ApiError`s containing the HTTP status and backend error when available;
cancelled requests remain abort errors.

## 4. Main flow: create a student

The flow the architecture exists to prove: _write, react_. The backend is shown as one box; its internals are in the backend docs.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor U as Agent
    participant S as mfe-student
    participant API as Backend
    participant H as Host
    participant BUS as In-page bus
    participant A as mfe-activity
    participant D as mfe-dashboard

    U->>S: fill form, submit
    S->>API: POST /students (Bearer JWT)
    alt rejected (401, 403, 4xx)
        API-->>S: error
        S->>S: show error message
    else created
        API-->>S: 201 Created with student
        S->>S: show "Estudante cadastrado."
        S->>S: Insert student into its query cache
        API-->>H: STUDENT_CREATED on the host WebSocket
        H->>BUS: dispatch domain:event envelope and domain:STUDENT_CREATED
        BUS-->>S: envelope with eventId
        S->>S: deduplicate and reconcile student cache
        BUS-->>A: envelope with eventId
        A->>A: merge event into bounded history cache
        BUS-->>D: envelope with eventId
        D->>D: coalesce event invalidations for 100 ms
        D->>API: GET /institutions, /students, /enrollments in parallel
        D->>D: update dashboard query cache and KPIs
    end
```

The student list is updated from the create response and reconciled with the
domain event. Event delivery is best effort; Activity seeds its bounded cache
from `/events/history` on mount and adds supported live events.

## 5. Event contract: frontend vs backend

What `@mfe/shared` declares, compared with what the backend emits today.

| Event type                                             | Declared in `@mfe/shared` | Emitted by backend | Consumed by                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `STUDENT_CREATED`                                      | yes                       | yes                | Student, Activity, Dashboard  |
| `STUDENT_TRANSFERRED`                                  | yes                       | yes                | Activity, Dashboard           |
| `ENROLLMENT_SUSPENDED`                                 | yes                       | yes                | Activity, Dashboard           |
| `ENROLLMENT_REOPENED`                                  | yes                       | yes                | Activity, Dashboard           |
| `INSTITUTION_CREATED`                                  | yes                       | **no**             | Institution, Admin, Dashboard |
| `INSTITUTION_UPDATED`                                  | yes                       | **no**             | Institution, Admin, Dashboard |
| `INSTITUTION_INACTIVATED`                              | yes                       | **no**             | Institution, Admin, Dashboard |
| `STUDENT_UPDATED`                                      | yes                       | **no**             | Student, Dashboard            |
| `ENROLLMENT_CREATED`                                   | yes                       | yes                | Dashboard                     |
| `USER_UPDATED`                                         | yes                       | yes                | Admin                         |
| `GROUP_MEMBERSHIP_UPDATED`, `GROUP_MEMBERSHIP_REMOVED` | yes                       | yes                | Admin                         |

The frontend schemas match the backend envelope and payloads: institution
scope is carried by the optional `institutionIds` envelope field, while
`ENROLLMENT_SUSPENDED` and `ENROLLMENT_REOPENED` carry only their student and
enrollment identifiers (plus `reason` and `date` for suspension). The backend
emits these payloads in its
[enrollment handlers](https://github.com/fidelis27/secretaria-backend/blob/main/internal/adapters/httpserver/server.go),
[user handler](https://github.com/fidelis27/secretaria-backend/blob/main/internal/adapters/httpserver/user_handler.go)
and
[group handler](https://github.com/fidelis27/secretaria-backend/blob/main/internal/adapters/httpserver/group_handler.go).

## 6. Deployment topology

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    gh["GitHub<br/>CI: lint, typecheck, test,<br/>a11y, contrast, audit, build"]

    subgraph vercel["Vercel (6 projects)"]
        vh["host"]
        v1["mfe-institution"]
        v2["mfe-student"]
        v3["mfe-admin"]
        v4["mfe-activity"]
        v5["mfe-dashboard"]
    end

    api["secretaria-backend<br/>(external)"]
    supa["Supabase Auth"]

    gh --> vercel
    vh -- "VITE_MFE_*_URL" --> v1
    vh -- "VITE_MFE_*_URL" --> v2
    vh -- "VITE_MFE_*_URL" --> v3
    vh -- "VITE_MFE_*_URL" --> v4
    vh -- "VITE_MFE_*_URL" --> v5
    vh -- "VITE_API_URL" --> api
    vh -- "VITE_SUPABASE_URL" --> supa
```

Each package builds and deploys on its own. The host only knows remote origins through build-time variables.

---

## 7. Current runtime behavior

- The host maintains one WebSocket while active. Any remote uses the shared
  authenticated WebSocket fallback only when the host is unavailable.
- Each remote provides its own TanStack `QueryClient`. Cache keys and data are
  isolated by remote; the query library itself is a federation singleton.
- Query functions pass TanStack Query's `AbortSignal` through feature APIs to
  the shared request helper. Unmounting a remote cancels its in-flight queries.
- Student creation inserts the returned resource into the Student cache.
  Validated domain events carry `eventId` through the bus so remotes can
  deduplicate cache updates and invalidations.
- Activity loads the latest 30 events on mount and merges supported live events
  into its bounded cache.
- Dashboard coalesces relevant domain events for 100 ms before refreshing its
  three data sources in parallel.
- Event delivery is best effort; reconnecting does not replay missed events.
- The frontend does not send `x-correlation-id` with HTTP requests.
- Backend authorization and emitted event behavior are authoritative; the event contract comparison in section 5 shows the frontend declarations and current backend emissions.
